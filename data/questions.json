        "question": "A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the totalweight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?",
        "choices": ["2", "4", "5", "6"],
        "answer": "5",
        "explanation": "Choice C is correct. Let a equal the number of 120-pound packages, and let b equal the number of 100-pound packages. Its given that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds: the inequality represents this situation. Its also given that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages: the inequality represents this situation. Values of a and b that satisfy these two inequalities represent the allowable numbers of 120-pound packages and 100-pound packages the helicopter can transport. To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, a, in the helicopter, the number of 100-pound packages, b, in the helicopter needs to be minimized. Expressing b in terms of a in the second inequality yields , so the minimum value of b is equal to . Substituting for b in the first inequality results in . Using the distributive property to rewrite this inequality yields , or . Subtracting 1,000 from both sides of this inequality yields . Dividing both sides of this inequality by 20 results in . This means that the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 5. Choices A, B, and D are incorrect and may result from incorrectly creating or solving the system of inequalities"

    "question": "A window repair specialist charges $220 for the first two hours of repair plus an hourly fee for each additional hour. The total cost for 5 hours of repair is $400. Which function f gives the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair, where x >= 2?",
    "choices": ["60x + 100", "60x + 220", "80x", "80x + 220"],
    "answer": "60x + 100",
    "explanation": "Choice A is correct. Its given that the window repair specialist charges $ 220 for the first two hours of repair plus an hourly fee for each additional hour. Let n represent the hourly fee for each additional hour after the first two hours. Since its given that x is the number of hours of repair, it follows that the charge generated by the hourly fee after the first two hours can be represented by the expression nx - 2. Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is f(x) = 220 + nx - 2. Its given that the total cost for 5 hours of repair is $ 400. Substituting 5 for x and 400 for f(x) into the equation  f(X) = 220 + nx - 2 yields 400 = 220 + n5 - 2, or 400 = 220 + 3n. Subtracting 220 from both sides of this equation yields 180 = 3n. Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 yields n = 60. Substituting 60 for n in the equation f(x) = 220 + nx - 2 yields f(x) = 220 + 60x - 2, which is equivalent to f(x) = 220 + 60x - 120, or f(x) = 60x + 100. Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is  f(x) = 60x + 100. Choice B is incorrect. This function represents the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair where the specialist charges $ 340, rather than $ 220, for the first two hours of repair. Choice C is incorrect. This function represents the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair where the specialist charges $ 160, rather than $ 220, for the first two hours of repair, and an hourly fee of $ 80, rather than $ 60, after the first two hours. Choice D is incorrect. This function represents the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair where the specialist charges $ 380, rather than $ 220, for the first two hours of repair, and an hourly fee of $ 80, rather than $ 60, after the first two hours."

    "question": "Hector used a tool called an auger to remove corn from a storage bin at a constant rate. The bin contained 24,000 bushels of corn when Hector began to use the auger. After 5 hours of using the auger, 19,350 bushels of corn remained in the bin. If the auger continues to remove corn at this rate, what is the total number of hours Hector will have been using the auger when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in the bin?",
    "choices": ["3", "7", "8", "12"],
    "answer": "12",
    "explanation": "Choice D is correct. After using the auger for 5 hours, Hector had removed 24,000 - 19,350 = 4,650 bushels of corn from the storage bin. During the 5-hour period, the auger removed corn from the bin at a constant rate of bushels per hour. Assuming the auger continues to remove corn at this rate, after x hours it will have removed 930x bushels of corn. Because the bin contained 24,000 bushels of corn when Hector started using the auger, the equation 24,000 - 930x = 12,840 can be used to find the number of hours, x, Hector will have been using the auger when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in the bin. Subtracting 12,840 from both sides of this equation and adding 930x to both sides of the equation yields 11,160 = 930x. Dividing both sides of this equation by 930 yields x = 12. Therefore, Hector will have been using the auger for 12 hours when 12,840 bushels of corn remain in the storage bin. Choice A is incorrect. Three hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 - 3(930) = 21,210 bushels of corn remained, not 12,840. Choice B is incorrect. Seven hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 - 7(930) = 17,490 bushels of corn will remain, not 12,840. Choice C is incorrect. Eight hours after Hector began using the auger, 24,000 - 8(930) = 16,560 bushels of corn will remain, not 12,840."

    "choices": ["2", "3", "4", "9"],
    "answer": "3",
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct. When a data set has an odd number of values, the median can be found by ordering the values from least to greatest and determining the value in the middle. Since the values are already presented in order from least to greatest and there are 7 values, the median is the fourth value in the list. Therefore, the median is 3. Choice A is incorrect. This is the mode. Choice C is incorrect. This is the mean. Choice D is incorrect. This is the range."

    "question": "A sample of 40 fourth-grade students was selected at random from a certain school. The 40 students completed a survey about the morning announcements, and 32 thought the announcements were helpful. Which of the following is the largest population to which the results of the survey can be applied?",
    "choices": ["The 40 students who were surveyed", "All fourth-grade students at the school", "All students at the school", " All fourth-grade students in the county in which the school is located"],
    "answer": "All fourth-grade students at the school",
    "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Selecting a sample of a reasonable size at random to use for a survey allows the results from that survey to be applied to the population from which the sample was selected, but not beyond this population. In this case, the population from which the sample was selected is all fourth-grade students at a certain school. Therefore, the results of the survey can be applied to all fourth-grade students at the school. Choice A is incorrect. The results of the survey can be applied to the 40 students who were surveyed. However, this isnt the largest group to which the results of the survey can be applied. Choices C and D are incorrect. Since the sample was selected at random from among the fourth-grade students at a certain school, the results of the survey cant be applied to other students at the school or to other fourth-grade students who werent represented in the survey results. Students in other grades in the school or other fourth-grade students in the country may feel differently about announcements than the fourth-grade students at the school"

    "question": "Residents of a town were surveyed to determine whether they are satisfied with the concession stand at the local park. A random sample of 200 residents was selected. All 200 responded, and 87% said they are satisfied. Based on this information, which of the following statements must be true? I. Of all the town residents, 87% would say they are satisfied with the concession stand at the local park. II. If another random sample of 200 residents were surveyed, 87% would say they are satisfied.",
    "choices": ["Neither", "I only", "II only", "I and II"],
    "answer": "Neither",
    "explanation": "Choice A is correct. The purpose of surveying a random sample of residents is to approximate the percent of the town residents that are satisfied with the concession stand. The sample doesnt necessarily get the same result as surveying every resident of the town, nor would another sample necessarily have identical results. Therefore, although its possible that either statement I or statement II could prove true by surveying every resident of the town, these statements cannot be proven true solely based on the results of the sample. Choice B is incorrect because surveying a sample of the town residents may not have the same result as surveying all the town residents. Choices C and D are incorrect because surveying a different sample of residents could yield different results."

    "question": "In an article about exercise, it is estimated that a 160-pound adult uses 200 calories for every 30 minutes of hiking and 150 calories for every 30 minutes of bicycling. An adult who weighs 160 pounds has completed 1 hour of bicycling. Based on the article, how many hours should the adult hike to use a total of 1,900 calories from bicycling and hiking?",
    "choices": ["9.5", "8.75", "6", "4"],
    "answer": "4",
    "explanation": "Choice D is correct. Since a 160-pound adult uses 200 calories for every 30 minutes of hiking, then the same adult uses calories after hiking for h 30-minute periods. Similarly, the same adult uses calories after bicycling for b 30-minute periods. Therefore, the equation represents the situation where a 160-pound adult uses a total of 1,900 calories from hiking for h 30-minute periods and bicycling for b 30-minute periods. Its given that the adult completes 1 hour, or 2 30-minute periods, of bicycling. Substituting 2 for b in the equation yields , or . Subtracting 300 from both sides of this equation yields . Dividing both sides by 200 yields . Since h represents the number of 30-minute periods spent hiking and there are 2 30-minute periods in every hour, it follows that the adult will need to hike for , or 4 hours to use a total of 1,900 calories from bicycling and hiking. Choice A is incorrect and may result from solving the equation . This represents 0 30-minute periods bicycling instead of 2. Choice B is incorrect and may result from solving the equation . This represents 1 30-minute period of bicycling instead of 2. Choice C is incorrect. This may result from determining thatthe number of 30-minute periods the adult should hike is 8, but then subtracting 2 from 8, rather than dividing 8 by 2, to find the number of hours the adult should hike."
